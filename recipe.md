How To Make Red Velvet Cake step by step.......


step1. First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C). Next let's make our cake batter. Start by creating your batter and your white granulated or casted sugar together in a laarge bowl. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

step 2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, six, once that egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the slides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

step 3. Now we add in our cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whole process we don't want to over mix ,just until things are incorporated. If we mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets in our cake.

step 4. Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. If if you dont have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.

step 5. Now we add our oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 Tablespoons of red food coloring liquid. Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red color . Set that mixture aside for now.

step 6. Now we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all purpose flour. Cake flour tends to work a little bit batter, but all-purpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingrdiants.

step 7. Next we will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture and mix until just combined . Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingrediants have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

step 8. Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pan will equal amount of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pan and then dust them with cocoa powder or flour an I always add a little roun cut out of paper on the bottom too as added precautions , and my non stick pans are great, but I like to over-do it. Also it is a good idea ti lightly tap the pan with the batter in it, this will allow any cake bubble to rise to the top , which helps to prevent air pockets, but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them, a combination of over mixing, etc. But it won't effect the taste of the cake for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step 9. Now after the cake comes out of the oven let's leave them alone and allow them to cool in their pan for about 10 minutes. After that we can remove them from their pan, remove the paper and then let the cake cool completely on the rack . Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the frosting, or just go onto the frosting step now, It's totally up to you!

step 10. Well now it is time to make frosting, we will be using just a few ingrediants, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and out of course powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar).

step 11. Now combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a large bowl and mix with a hand mixer until nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes. Then slowly incorporate all of the powdered sugar. You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want. Next just remove th beaters. Frosting is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still too runny add more powdered sugar, or just chill it for about 30 minutes before foresting that cake.


step 12. First we will trip the cake so it will be some level. You can skip this step if you like. I just always use my bread knife to cut the top off the bottom layer, if you want to use I recommend cuting the top of the top layer off as well , the end product will look a bit batter. Next add a bunch of frosting to the middle, then layer the top layer of the cake on. Then cover whole cake with the foresting. There are a variety of tools that you can use, I normally use my cake spatula. Once done put the cake in the fridge about 30 minutes. This is optional, but I like to do it, allows the frosting to set a bit.

step 13. Now I want to make a heart shaped cake topper. To do that I take my heart cookies cutter and cut out a shape from the middle of that piece of cake that I have. Then just place it on top of your cake. Looks pretty neat right?

step 14. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers. Then gently apply it do your cake sides or on top or skip this step. It is totally up to you how you decorate your cake. Use a piping bag and pipe frosting around the top of your heart if you like,You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!
